## C++ Learning Short Summary || C++学习短评

真的环境真的是语言学习曲线里面最重要的一环。你想python ubuntu自带，pip安装。js，node一装完事，npm安装不用愁。  
这C++我真的是，从第一个项目开始花时间最多的地方就是装tmd的东西，ubuntu apt里面的cmake居然不是最新的，还要我去下载做ln。说实在的，我之前可能真的对linux系统了解很少，不知道一般安装文件是怎么样的，就是apt跑一下，现在都知道了。最麻烦的是有些包还要当场make，make还容易出问题。  
而且这些网课，为了吸引学生吧，其实在表现层做的太多了，项目的结果都是可视化的。看起来是很有意思，但其实没什么用，而且为了这些可视化你还不得不装很多东西。搞得一开始都是在装东西了。  
不过这也不是什么大问题，真实工作中安装东西的事情也不少。就算简单如nodejs我当初在配置开发环境这个环节也花费了一些功夫。

One of the most important component to consider the learning curve for programming language learning, is preparing the developing environment. For python, default in ubuntu, using pip to install modules. For JS, everything done when you installed node, npm will handle the rest.  
For C++, I hate to say that, from the first project, I spend most of my time installing stuff. Can you believe that I have to install cmake myself? Ubuntu apt dont support latest cmake, I have to use ln. To be honest, I only have few understanding of linux. I just use apt to install software. Thanks to the project, I know all. And some package even needs me to make it on my own.  
And, in order to get more students' attentions, these online courses, put much effect to make the result of the project looks good. Yes, virtually good. However, that actually just make your project looks nice, but that did nothing on your coding practice. And that's why I have to install opencv for the project, which took a lot of time.  
After all, I have to say that even I complained so much, This is not bad at all, in real life, when I am working, things like this do happen. Even when I using JS at my job, I spent a lot of time on preparing the development environment.

## Mumbling Starts || 呓语起源 

最近在学习C++，在翻看别人的blog的时候看到有人有这样一种简单的短文章记录的方式，放在一个网页中一点点写下去。我觉得这个形式很好，我平时有很多简短的话，不成文，无处安放，就放在这里吧。

I am learning c++ recently. When I was checking dev blogs, I found someone is using one page for all the spark of thoughts. I think this is a very good idea, because I always come up some words, but those words are too short to form a post and I cannot find a place to put them. Now I will have a place to put them.
