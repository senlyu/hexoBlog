Hi, Nice to meet you. My name is Sen Lyu. I am a Chinese and now working at United States.  

I spent most of my early days in eastern China, and then went to US for Master degree. I used to study on ecomonic/finance field, now I am more interested in software programming as my career.

I love the old-fashioned idea of American dream, a free land that we need to fight for the life. I dont have a religion, but I am fully grateful to God for what he helped me in the past.

I love computer games, I love management games. Also consider programming is kind of management with code.

I still have a lot to learn, and I will share what I learned in this blog.

Thank you.
