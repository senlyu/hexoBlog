# QCon 2022 Note
For me, I split all the talks I listened this time in QCon, into 3 categories:
- Tech Architecture Optimization
    - Tidy First
    - Scaling Bottleneck
- System Design Concept
    - Microservices Patterns
    - Orchestration vs Choreography
- System Design Implementation 
    - Adopting Continuous Deployment
    - Distributed In-Process Cache
    - Leveraging Determinism
    - Service Mesh
    - DynamoDB in Amazon
    - CosmosDB in Azure
    - Event Processing Service in Doordash
    - Blob Storage Service in Dropbox 

The categories are ordered from abstraction to concretization. I know most of the engineers like me are more interested in the low level of the implementations. And yes, some talks here(like the Determinism one is really really good), however, this time the first two categoriesâ€™ talk gave me the biggest influence. I think listening to these talks help me to understand the career path better. Sometimes people have to view things out of the box.

I really appreciate this time my company, Meta, sponsors me for this event.
